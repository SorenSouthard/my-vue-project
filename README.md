//README start
The following project is a website showcasing various functionalities from vue, vue-router, naive-ui and pinia. The website is designed to have three pages, accessible through a navigation links at the top of the page. Each page shows different functionalities. 

The homepage showcase localstorage with clicker and username functions that save their values even upon refreshing. The project list showcases various vue functionalities such as v-for, computed and watch for deriving data and tracking changes, and many others that allow for the dynamic creation of a project list that can be freely be expanded.

Finally, there is a contact section that was made to showcase the utility of v-model, which allows for the two way binding, enabling the creation of inputs that can be used to save contact details for those who have queries for the site.

Instructions:
The code uses pinia, vue, vue router, and naive-ui
In order to utilize these it is necessary to install them using the terminal. 

This is done by going into the project directory, "cd project" and then applying the following commands to install:
-npm install vue
-npm install naive-ui
-npm install vue-router
-npm install pinia
-npm install pinia-plugin-persistedstate

Then use npm run dev in order to run the program and gain access to a local host to host it. 

Challenges:
Some challenges I had faced during the coding of this project was in large part the creation of the css. The style of the project for viewing often meant completely changing around the various parts of the code and refashioning them so that they look presentable while also maintaining the functionality of the cite. 
In large part this was trial and error, and required some usage of ai in order to learn about the large assortment of potential tags that would enable various aesthetic decisions.

Another challange I had faced was of course simply making functional code. I did try to go through things without without reference as much as possible. That said, in class resource were used more than I had originally hoped in order to complete the project. I did do somethings subtly different, and did add some additional functionality, like category tags dissapearing when you click on a filter of the same type. But I did feel like much of the project was retreading the in class material.
